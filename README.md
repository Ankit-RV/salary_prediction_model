Salary Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

In this project, I learn how to make a Machine Learning Model for salary prediction based on various factors like 10th marks, 12th marks, degree etc. and submit the results for evaluation.

In this project I did:

- Exploratory Data Analysis to visualize the data.
- Handling Missing Numerical Values.
- Encoding Categorical Features.
- Encoding Categorical Features with multiple classes.
- Training the Model.
